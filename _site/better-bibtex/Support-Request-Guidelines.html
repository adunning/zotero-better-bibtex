        <h3>Support Request Guidelines</h3>

        <h1 id="support-request-guidelines">Support Request Guidelines</h1>

<p>Before all else, <strong><em>thank you for taking the time for submitting an issue</em></strong>, and I’m sorry that I’ve probably
interrupted your flow.</p>

<h2 id="known-problems">Known problems</h2>

<p>Before submitting an issue, please make sure this isn’t a known problem. Known problems are either already on my radar,
or there are problems preventing me from implementing a fix.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>You see the BBT translator listed twice</strong>. If you see a duplicate translator for Better BibLaTeX, go to
“preferences/advanced/files”, reset translators and restart.</li>
  <li><strong>Odd characters after import</strong>. Zotero doesn’t seem to handle importing of non-utf8 files particularly gracefully. If
you’re coming from JabRef, please verify in JabRef using file-database properties that your bibliography is saved in utf-8
format before importing.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="submitting-an-issue---please-read-carefully">Submitting an issue - please read carefully</h2>

<p>If you have any questions on the use of the plugin, please do not hesitate to file a GitHub issue to ask for help. If
you’re reporting a bug in the plugin, please take a moment to glance through the Support Request Guidelines; it will
make sure I get your problem fixed as quick as possible. Clear bug reports commonly have time-to-fix of 10 minutes. The
guidelines are very detailed, perhaps to the point of being off-putting, but please do not fret; these guidelines
simply express my ideal bug submission. I of course prefer very clearly documented issue reports over fuzzy ones, but I
prefer fuzzy ones over missed ones.</p>

<p>My time is extremely limited for a number of very great reasons (you shall have to trust me on this). Because of this, I
cannot accept bug reports or support requests on anything but the latest version, currently at <strong>0.6.10</strong>.</p>

<p>If you submit an issue report,</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Please make <em>sure</em> you are on the latest version</strong>, currently <strong>0.6.10</strong>. Auto-update will usually take care of it.</li>
  <li><strong>Please include <em>specifics</em> of what doesn’t work</strong>. I use this plugin every day myself, so “it doesn’t work” is trivially
false. Please tell me what you expected and what you see happening, and the relevant difference between them.</li>
  <li><strong>Please don’t file a jumble of problems in one issue</strong>. Posting a slew of separate issues is much preferred, as I can
more easily tackle them one by one.</li>
  <li><strong>Do not hijack existing issues</strong>. You can chime in on existing issues if you’re close to certain it is the same problem,
otherwise, open a new issue. I rather have duplicate issues than issues I cannot close because they are in fact two or
more issues.</li>
  <li><strong>If your problem pertains to <em>importing BibTeX files</em>,</strong> you <strong><em>must</em></strong> put up a sample for me to reproduce the issue with.
<em>Do not</em> paste the sample in the issue, as the issue tracker will format it into oblivion. Instead, choose one of
these options:
    <ul>
      <li>Post an URL in the issue where I can download your sample, or</li>
      <li>Put the sample in a <a href="https://gist.github.com/">gist</a> and post the URL of the gist into the issue, or </li>
      <li>upload your files to <a href="http://dbinbox.com/allthatisthecase">dbinbox</a> – please use descriptive file names (at least
the issue number), as I can’t see who uploaded what.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>If your problem pertains to <em>exporting BibTeX files</em>,</strong> you <strong><em>must</em></strong> put up a sample for me to reproduce the issue
with, exported in <code>Zotero TestCase</code> format. For making the sample available to me: see ‘import issues’ in the
point directly above.</li>
  <li><strong>If your problem pertains to BBT interfering with other plugins</strong> (which wouldn’t be the first time), and this interference
has something to do with importing, you <strong><em>must</em></strong> include a sample file that triggers the issue. I know it may seem
that “any file triggers it” – I need a <em>specific</em> file that does so I know we’re looking at the same problem.</li>
</ul>
